            Are you interested in helping run an annual event which helps nearly
            <b>1,000 students</b> learn about and build with technology? If so,
            <b>apply to be an organizer for HackUMass X!</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            For the past nine years, HackUMass has grown to become the
            <b>largest student-run technology event on campus</b> -- and the
            second largest student-run event overall besides Homecoming. We are
            looking for students interested in volunteering their time to help
            prepare for HackUMass X, which will occur in October/November 2022.
            The organizing team starts working mid-way through the Spring
            semester to plan out the event.
          </p>

          <p>
            No matter your interests or background, there are a variety of
            different roles which we are looking to fill in our organizing team.
            Whether it's helping plan out the logistics of the event and
            coordinating with sponsors, or running our hardware inventory and
            building technology tools to help run the event, applications for
            our organizing team are now open and are due on
            <b>11:59 PM ET on April 8th, 2022</b>!
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
                        If you're interested, <b>please come to our info session on Wednesday, January 22nd at 7:30PM in ILC room S331</b>. There will be a brief presentation and
                        Q&A session about what it's like to be an organizer, and some light snacks!
